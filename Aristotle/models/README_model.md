# Models

In the `models` folder, you can store your trained language models. We suggest using either LLaMA-3 or a quantized version of GPT for this project. Here are some steps to get you started:

1. **LLaMA-3**: Fine-tune the LLaMA-3 model on your dataset.
2. **Quantized GPT**: Utilize a quantized version of GPT for efficient inference on smaller devices.

Refer to the `README_models.md` file in the `models` folder for more details.

## Notebooks

The `notebooks` folder is designed for your creative explorations and experiments. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Use Jupyter notebooks to explore and visualize your dataset. This helps in understanding the data better and in making informed preprocessing decisions.
2. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Document the steps of training your models, including hyperparameter tuning, evaluation metrics, and performance analysis.
3. **Interactive Demos**: Create interactive notebooks that demonstrate the capabilities of your trained models. These can be shared with others to showcase your work.
