# Models

In the `models` folder, you can store your trained language models. We suggest using either LLaMA-3 or a quantized version of GPT for this project. Here are some steps to get you started:

1. **LLaMA-3**: Fine-tune the LLaMA-3 model on your dataset.
2. **Quantized GPT**: Utilize a quantized version of GPT for efficient inference on smaller devices.

Refer to the `README_models.md` file in the `models` folder for more details.

## Notebooks

The `notebooks` folder is designed for your creative explorations and experiments. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Use Jupyter notebooks to explore and visualize your dataset. This helps in understanding the data better and in making informed preprocessing decisions.
2. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Document the steps of training your models, including hyperparameter tuning, evaluation metrics, and performance analysis.
3. **Interactive Demos**: Create interactive notebooks that demonstrate the capabilities of your trained models. These can be shared with others to showcase your work.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yash2378/Digital-Immortality.git
   cd Digital-Immortality/Aristotle
Set Up Environment Variables:
Ensure you have set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable:

bash
Copy code
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"  # For Unix-like systems
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key  # For Windows Command Prompt
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"  # For Windows PowerShell
Run Scripts:
Use the provided scripts in the src folder for various tasks like data extraction, preprocessing, fine-tuning, and monitoring.

Contributing

### Adding Placeholder Files to Git

1. **Navigate to the `models` Folder**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop/GIT/Digital-Immortality/Aristotle/models
Create and Add README_models.md:
bash
Copy code
echo "# Models Folder
This folder is intended to store the trained models for the Digital Immortality Project.

Suggested Models
We recommend using the following models for this project:

LLaMA-3: Fine-tune the LLaMA-3 model on your dataset.
Quantized GPT: Utilize a quantized version of GPT for efficient inference on smaller devices.
Usage
Place your trained model files in this folder. For example:

llama-3-model.pth
quantized-gpt-model.bin
Download Pre-trained Models
If you don't have trained models yet, you can download pre-trained models and place them here. For example:

```python
import os
import urllib.request

URL of the pre-trained model
model_url = "https://example.com/path/to/pretrained/model.bin\"

Path to save the downloaded model
model_path = os.path.join("models", "pretrained-model.bin")

Download the model
urllib.request.urlretrieve(model_url, model_path)

print("Model downloaded and saved to", model_path)
```

Note
Ensure your model files are properly named and documented for ease of use and reference.
