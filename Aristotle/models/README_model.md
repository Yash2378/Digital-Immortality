# Models

In the `models` folder, you can store your trained language models. We suggest using either LLaMA-3 or a quantized version of GPT for this project. Here are some steps to get you started:

1. **LLaMA-3**: Fine-tune the LLaMA-3 model on your dataset.
2. **Quantized GPT**: Utilize a quantized version of GPT for efficient inference on smaller devices.

## Usage

Place your trained model files in this folder. For example:
- `llama-3-model.pth`
- `quantized-gpt-model.bin`

## Download Pre-trained Models

If you don't have trained models yet, you can download pre-trained models and place them here. For example:

```python
import os
import urllib.request

# URL of the pre-trained model
model_url = "https://example.com/path/to/pretrained/model.bin"

# Path to save the downloaded model
model_path = os.path.join("models", "pretrained-model.bin")

# Download the model
urllib.request.urlretrieve(model_url, model_path)

print("Model downloaded and saved to", model_path)```

Download Pre-trained Models
If you don't have trained models yet, you can download pre-trained models and place them here. For example:

```python
import os
import urllib.request

URL of the pre-trained model
model_url = "https://example.com/path/to/pretrained/model.bin\"

Path to save the downloaded model
model_path = os.path.join("models", "pretrained-model.bin")

Download the model
urllib.request.urlretrieve(model_url, model_path)

print("Model downloaded and saved to", model_path)
