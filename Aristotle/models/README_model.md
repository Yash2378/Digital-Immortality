# Models

In the `models` folder, you can store your trained language models. We suggest using either LLaMA-3 or a quantized version of GPT for this project. Here are some steps to get you started:

1. **LLaMA-3**: Fine-tune the LLaMA-3 model on your dataset.
2. **Quantized GPT**: Utilize a quantized version of GPT for efficient inference on smaller devices.
